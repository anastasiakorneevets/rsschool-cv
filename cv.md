## Summary 

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
Yeah, a different city every night oh right  
I swear the world better prepare  
For when I'm a [billionaire](https://music.yandex.by/album/95355/track/846464)
